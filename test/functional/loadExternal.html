    <p>Demo of how to use the <tt>src</tt> attribute for loading X3D data.</p>
    <p><b style="color:red">Caution:</b> This is the same as using an inline - loading a scene with Ajax.
        You would expect that the browser does the loading when a <tt>src</tt> attribute occurs.
        <b>IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY</b> in this case. Be aware when using the src attribute. That you are
        actually dealing with inlines.</p>
        <p>Best practice is NOT to use the src attribute, but instead add the inline to make clear what is happening.</p>
<p> You will also have to set <tt>X3DOM_SECURITY_OFF = true</tt> globally before you include X3DOM.</p>
