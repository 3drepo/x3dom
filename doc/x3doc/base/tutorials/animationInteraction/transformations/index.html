        <p>
		Within this tutorial, you will learn how to create simple 3D manipulators in X3DOM.		
		Such manipulators will allow you to dynamically change an object's 3D transformation, by interacting with your mouse pointer or finger on some 3D geometry.
		Some parts of this tutorial are also covered by <a href='http://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/components/pointingsensor.html'>X3D</a>
		and <a href='http://accad.osu.edu/~pgerstma/class/vnv/resources/info/AnnotatedVrmlRef/ch3-334.htm'>VRML</a> specification or tutorial resources,
		which explain the concept of pointing device sensors.
        </p>
		
		<p>
		As the X3D concept of pointing device sensors, which will be used to realize the 3D manipulators during this tutorial, is pretty abstract and very generalized,
		it might be helpful to start off with a concrete example.
		In the following figure, you can see a teapot, and two different kinds of manipulators.

            </div>
        </div>
		
		<p>
		The cyan handle on the bottom left of the figure is a translation manipulator.
		It can be dragged to the left or right side, always following the edge of the ground plane.
		The teapot will then be translated by exactly the same amount as the handle.		
		The three colored bands around the teapot are rotation handles.
		By dragging those, the user can rotate the teapot object around the three principal axes of the coordinate system, X, Y and Z.
		If you like, try out the <a href='example.html'>example</a> now, to see the manipulators in action.

		<h2>Interactive 3D Translation with PlaneSensor</h2>
		<p>
		We will now dive into the example more deeply, and first see how the translation manipulator was realized, using a <i>PlaneSensor</i> node.
		In X3D (and thereby in X3DOM as well), there are several kinds of nodes that are especially designed for user interaction on 3D elements.
		Those nodes are grouped together in the <i>Pointing Device Sensor</i> component.
		All pointing device sensor nodes have in common that they produce output as soon as the user interacts with a corresponding piece of so-called <i>sensor geometry</i>.
		A pointing device sensor node, like PlaneSensor, will consider all kinds of pointer interaction (for example, clicking a mouse, or moving the pointer)
		that are triggered on its sensor geometry, and produce some form of output. The sensor geometry that belongs to a pointing device sensor is the geometry that is
		a sibling node of the sensor node, or a descendant of a sibling node of the sensor node. Sounds complicated?
		Well, it is actually not that complicated! Let's come back to our example:
		The cyan handle is used to trigger translations on the teapot, and on the colored bands around it. The 3D translation event is produced by a plane sensor,
		and the plane sensor uses the handle as its sensor geometry. This means that, as soon as the user drags the handle, a translation event will be fired by the plane sensor,
		and some parts of the scene will be moved.
		The X3D description of the plane sensor and its handle looks like the following:
